# Mobile_Sales_PowerBi
UPI is beating Credit Cards, and other things I learned from 3,000+ sales.

Just wrapped up a sales analysis dashboard for the Indian mobile market.

I wanted to move beyond just "making charts" and actually answer business questions. Three interesting things the data showed me:

💸 Cash is not king anymore: UPI accounts for 26% of all transactions.

⭐ Quality perception: Despite lower price points, Xiaomi users rate their devices higher on average than some premium brands.

📱 The Youth Market: If you're selling to anyone under 25, it’s almost exclusively Apple.

The dashboard (attached) lets you drill down by City and Brand to see these trends yourself.

Built with Power BI + Excel.
